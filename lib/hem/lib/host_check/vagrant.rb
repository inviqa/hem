Vagrant produced an error while checking its presence.

This is usually caused by using the vagrant gem which is no longer supported.

Uninstall any gem version of vagrant with the following command selecting "yes" to any prompt:
  gem uninstall vagrant

You can then download and install the latest version from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

If you do not have any vagrant gems installed it may be possible that a gem such as vagrant-wrapper is installed and is failing.

Please seek assistance from #devops if this is the case.
