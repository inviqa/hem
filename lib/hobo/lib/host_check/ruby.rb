You're using a system ruby install which can cause issues with installing Gems and running some older projects.

rbenv is HIGHLY recommended.

You can install it with the following command:
  curl https://raw.github.com/fesplugas/rbenv-installer/master/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

Once installed, run the following to set it as the default ruby and re-install hobo-inviqa:
  rbenv install 1.9.3-p448 && rbenv global 1.9.3-448 && gem install hobo-inviqa

	require "rbconfig"
	which = File.join(RbConfig::CONFIG["bindir"], RbConfig::CONFIG["ruby_install_name"])
        unless which =~ /\.rbenv|\.rvm|jruby/
          raise Hobo::HostCheckError.new("Hobo is running under a system ruby", advice)

The ordering of your system paths may cause a problem with Gems.

Unfortunately we can't automatically fix this for you at this time.

Please seek assistance.

Your paths were detected as:

#{ENV['PATH'].split(':').join("\n")}
