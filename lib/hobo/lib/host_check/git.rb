        advice = <<-EOF
You're using git with the core.autocrlf option enabled.

This setting can often cause problems when you clone a repository on windows but need to execute the contents of that repository within a linux VM.

You can disable autocrlf globally with the following command:
  git config --global core.autocrlf false

Disabling this setting will cause git to see all line endings as changed in a repository that was cloned with it enabled.
As such, you must either enable it just for those repositories or delete and re-clone them with the setting disabled.

You can enable the setting on a per-clone basis by ensuring that you are in the project directory and executing the following command:
  git config core-autocrlf true
EOF
        begin
          value = shell "git config core.autocrlf", :capture => true
          if value != "false"
